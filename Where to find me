Hey it's me again! You can find me at OBC church-Botswana(Gaborone) tomorrow(12/21/2025) at around 9AM(that's when the service starts). I'll be in a brown t-shirt, green pants and green addidas shoes. We can meet right after the service. Look out for someone 
coming out of the men's bathroom wearing this attire(after the service-that's if you dont spot me earlier). That would be me. I will be with my family, but based off this description, you should be able to easily identify me. Please send your agents who I'm hoping
are roughly the same age as me(late teens)  and we shall discuss terms from there. If all goes well(which i know it will) we'll work more together in the future. If you wanna know how I figured you guys exist, we can discuss that too once we actually meet tomorrow. I will
do my best to be by myself so I'm easily approacable. See you tomorrow!  

P.S.
If you end up in the service(which I highly advise) please don't be afraid to introduce yourselves as visitors.The people there are very welcoming. See you tomorrow.
