
I'm aware of your existence. Believe me, I'm no threat(unless you need me to be). Wakanda(or whatever you guys call yourselves), i wanna get mentored and recruited by you guys. Why you ask? Because you have the resources and the technological advancements to make my visions come to life. Plus It would also be cool to see what your nation would look like. I'm no thrill seeker(well me typing this message it appears i may be but), I'm just a kid looking to see how he may take life to the next level. You won't regret it. You can trust me on that. Don't brush off this message  as if it's some other git hub junkie or whatever. I'm genuinely serious about this. And once you see this message-of which you will-you'll know where to find me. But I just have one condition, make your appearance in such a way only I'd be able to notice it's you guys. See you soon. Or sooner than soon. Like I said, you won't regret it.
